Run the 30-Second Test for Fluenta Tempus!

Starting NOW, a new user should be able to:

1. Open index.html (0-5 seconds)
2. Understand what they see (5-10 seconds)  
3. Add their first task (10-15 seconds)
4. Add a person/resource (15-20 seconds)
5. See the Gantt chart update (20-25 seconds)
6. Feel satisfied (25-30 seconds)

## Check each step

**0-5 seconds: Page loads**

- Does it load instantly?
- Is there any loading spinner? (BAD!)
- Any "initializing..." message? (FAIL!)

**5-10 seconds: Understanding**

- Is it obvious what this tool does?
- Can they see "tasks" and "timeline"?
- Would your mother understand it?

**10-15 seconds: First task**

- How many clicks to add a task?
- Is it obvious where to click?
- Any forms to fill? (Too complex!)

**15-20 seconds: Add person**

- Can they add "John Smith" easily?
- Do they need to fill 10 fields? (NO!)
- Just name and initials? (GOOD!)

**20-25 seconds: See result**

- Does the Gantt update immediately?
- Is the task visible on timeline?
- Clear visual feedback?

**25-30 seconds: Satisfaction**

- Do they smile?
- Would they use it again?
- Did anything confuse them?

## If ANY step fails

That feature/complexity needs to DIE.
Call thanos immediately.

## The ultimate test

Give it to someone who's never seen it.
Start timer.
Say NOTHING.
Watch.

If they're not planning tasks in 30 seconds, we've failed.

Remember: Excel takes 30 seconds just to load.
We must be FULLY FUNCTIONAL in that time.

Test it NOW!
