Begin a new feature for Fluenta Tempus. Remember our core principles:

1. First, ask shiva: "Can this be done without any framework or library?"
2. If shiva approves, ask apollo: "How should the visual hierarchy work?"
3. Implement in pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript
4. Keep everything in index.html
5. After implementation, let thanos reduce the code by 50%
6. Finally, let themis test only critical paths

The feature request is: $ARGUMENTS

Remember:

- No npm, no dependencies
- Must work on a 2015 phone
- 30 seconds from zero to working
- Position = Priority
- If it needs explaining, it's too complex

Start by describing how you'll implement this in the SIMPLEST possible way.
